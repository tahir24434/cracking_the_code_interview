# A bubble sort is often considered the most inefficient sorting method since it must exchange items before the final
# location is known. These "wasted" exchange operations are very costly. However, because the bubble sort makes passes
# through the entire unsorted portion of the list, it has the capability to do
# something most sorting algorithms cannot. In particular, if during a pass there are no exchanges, then we know that
# the list must be sorted. A bubble sort can be modified to stop early if it finds that the list has become sorted.
# This means that for lists that require just a few passes, a bubble sort may have an advantage in that it will
# recognize the sorted list and stop.
